2. All encoded data is pre-created in 'dataset/w2v'
3. If you want to run session04 from scratch, delete all files in 'datasets/w2v' folder and download http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/20news-bydate.tar.gz, extract and put it in datasets/20news-bydate folder
4. Run file 'rnn.py' (`python3 rnn.py`)
